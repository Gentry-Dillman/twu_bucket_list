-- Held first meeting with parter HJung. 
We did not get a lot completed. We are still trying to figure out gitlab/github.
Decided to meet next thursday

continued doing research on the project and was able to learn about recycler view and intents.

-- found partner is pulling out of class notified professor. 
I continued reviewing how to incorporate java programming. 
finished layout files for the application. 
all xml files are working and designed appropriately. 
Began working on the bucketModel.java // bucketListAdaptor.java 
  These are meant to move present and exchange the data from the additem to the recycler view to the editItem and back. 
Was able to get tests to show in recycler view. (feeling very accomplished at the moment.)

-- Reviewing what else needs to be done to complete milestone requirements
No data transfer as it sits. upon reviewing having test data presented and a few basic functions will be enough to get a 100 on the milestone. 
added check button to Lat and long add item screen. (this is in development stage. (upon reviewing the complications of taking in lat/long and presenting address my prove too difficult.)
